# Vulcan-Dictionary-Project
## This is a repository for a Vulcan Dictionary Database Class project

This repository is for the files and code I'm using to create a relational Vulcan Dictionary database (this is for a Linguistics Data Science class).
Disclaimer: I am new to coding and to github, so please bear with me!

The Data for this Vulcan Dictionary project was obtained from the Vulcan Language Institute (VLI) dictionary (archived on the wayback machine) and is based on Mark Gardner's (and colleagues') work on the Vulcan Language from the Star Trek television show franchise.

Initially, the project will be small-scale, because I only have a few weeks to complete the assignment, so it will only contain the Vulcan-Federation Standard (English) dictionary, the Federation Standard (English)-Vulcan dictionary, and the Vulcan-Klingon dictionary. Also, given that this data was collected for a linguistics project, this data will be curated according to tidy data principles, which means it will not appear in the same format that it did on the VLI website (e.g., I will be separating out information about pronunciation, part of speech...etc.).

Eventually, I hope to expand this project to include more of the dictionaries hosted on the VLI website, but I am just one person and I am new to creating dictionaries, so this may take quite a long time.

All of that said, I don't mean to step on anyone's toes. This project is being done out of a passion for the preservation of all the work done on the Vulcan language, and I realise that the work done has been a group effort--an effort that I was not involved in. I came into everything very late, when the VLI only existed on the wayback machine, so I only have a small idea of the immense amounts of work that have gone into the project before now. As a linguistics graduate student my only intention is to add my own part to all the work that was done before, and insodoing, preserve it for future generations.
